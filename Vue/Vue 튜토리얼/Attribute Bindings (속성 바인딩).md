# Attribute Bindings (속성 바인딩)



- in Vue, mustaches are only used for text interpolation. To bind an attribute to a dynamic value, we use the `v-bind` directive
- A **directive** is a special attribute that starts with the `v-` prefix. They are part of Vue's template syntax. Similar to text interpolations, directive values are JavaScript expressions that have access to the component's state.
